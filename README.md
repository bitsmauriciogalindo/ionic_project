All only with learning purposes.

For simulate a REST , i was used **https://my-json-server.typicode.com/** that use a JSON file on GitHub repository for 'simulate' a API REST with all methods: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE, (the POST, PUT or DELETE methods only return the response code but don't alter the data on json file of git).

My API REST is: **https://my-json-server.typicode.com/bitsmauriciogalindo/test/books**
